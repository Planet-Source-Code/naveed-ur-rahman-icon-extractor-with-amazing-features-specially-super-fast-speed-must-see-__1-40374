### Description

I extracted 100s of icons from shell32.dll, winword.exe, exel.exe, flash.exe, cool.dll, moricons.dll, pifmgr.dll and calculated time... Believe me, I was amazed because I do it all in only 15 seconds !!!. More over I have added some special features like changing the extracted Folder's icon, Writing a readme.txt file which contains all the file informations specially "ICON ALLOCATION" with which you can create some software that changes icon of "Self-Extractor of ZIP", Flash exe projector icon changer etc. Please Please Please VOTE FOR ME.

(IconEX 3.00 release on 2nd November 2002 - extract only 32x32 size of icons in resolution of 256 colors)
