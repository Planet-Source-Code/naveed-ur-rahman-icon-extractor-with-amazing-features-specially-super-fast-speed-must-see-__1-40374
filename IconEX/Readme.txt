Description:
This software helps you to extract icons from any type, any size of file e.g. exe, dll, ico, cur, ani etc.

Advance Features:

>>> Auto regestry:
	Whenever you run the software it will regester a menu item in regestry namely "Open with IconEX". Thus after running this software one time you will be able to open any file with IconEX 3.00 by just right-clicking the file (in explorer/my computer/dialog boxes..etc) and the clicking "Open with IconEX".
	REMOVING REGISTRY: When you close the program then an End Form appear containg two buttons. One of them is labeled as "Remove from Menu / Unregister :(". Click it to remove registry.

>>> WORKING:
*) You can extract icons from any file of any size in any directory you specify.
*) You can change the icon of directory where you extract icons.
*) Also, you can generate 72x72 BMP format of each icon.
*) Popup menu of some special directories.

>>> Readme file genertion:
	This version allow you to generate a Readme.txt file which contains some informations of the extracted icons and source file. It may be helpful for the programmers to know where the icons is integerated in the binay file. Thus you can create "Icon Changer" of pirticular files.

>>> LOOK:
*) All new attractive look.
*) "Keep window on top" function.
*) Smooth scrolling of progressbar really give it a professional look.

>>> DRAG and DROP feature:
*) You can drag and drop file (which you want to extract) from explorer to "File name:" box.
*) Also you can drag and drop folder (in which you want to extract icons) from explorer to "Extract to" box.

All the above drag and drop feature makes file selection easier.

Test:
You can test this software on the follwing files:
*)   shell32.dll (1.33 MB contains 134 icons)	[In system folder]
*)   Moricons.dll (83 KB contains 106 icons)	[In system folder]
*)   Pifmgr.dll (81 KB contains 39 icons)	[In system folder]
*)   Explorer.exe (181 KB contains 12 icons)	[In windows folder]
*)   iexplore.exe (1 KB contains 23 icons)	[\Program files\Internet explorer\]
or search any *.ani file and test on it. I am sure, it will work perfect.

Troubleshooting:
*) Icon of the folder doesn't change ???
	"Ask to change the icon of directory" must be 'ON' before you extract icons.

	Open the desktop.ini hidden in the folder where you extract icons in notepad, save it without making any changes and then close notepad. Refresh explorer. 

*) Speed is too slow ???
	`Off' "Generate readme" and "Also generate 72x72 BMP format of each icon". Now extract icons. Another reason may be the slow access to the media e.g. floppy disk etc.

Last few words:
	I am very thankful to you for tacking interest in my software. I hope it will work great on any PC and will give 100% results. If still there is some problem, ASK me. I shall try to remove your distress. 
	I have uploaded its source codes to www.planet-source-code.com. You can download them and also the compiled file (included in the zip). All my codes are full commented and easier.
